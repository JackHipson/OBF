# COLLECTIONS ADJUSTMENTS (to close -£1.45M/month gap)
# Non Prime: -£1.04M variance -> reduce collections by 11% (forecast is over-collecting vs budget)
NON PRIME,2025-10-01,2026-12-31,Coll_Principal,Multiply,0.89,Align Non Prime collections to budget (-11%)
# Near Prime Small: +£0.44M variance -> increase collections (forecast under-collecting vs budget shown as positive P&L)
NRP-S,2025-10-01,2026-12-31,Coll_Principal,Multiply,1.19,Align NRP-S collections to budget (+19%)
